A Minecraft datapack for the Create Fabric mod that adds new recipes for automation.

Place the Pack folder or the zip file in your world folder into datapacks folder.  <br /> 
example: .minecraft/saves/world1/datapacks/"this or other packs" <br /> 

Should work with every Launcher like [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org), [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com), [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app) or the normal [MC Launcher](https://www.minecraft.net).

Adds recipes to: <br /> 
Diamonds <br /> 
Copper <br /> 
Zinc
